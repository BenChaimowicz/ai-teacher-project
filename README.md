# AI learning course platform

Prototype from [`docs/spec.md`](docs/spec.md). Domain language lives in [`CONTEXT.md`](CONTEXT.md). Throwaway probes in `prototype/` are not this app.

## Run locally

Needs Node 22+, [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) (`npm install -g pnpm`), and a filled `.env` (copy `.env.example`; never commit secrets). Drizzle talks to hosted Supabase — there is no local database.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm db:seed
pnpm run apps
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:5173`. That one command starts the Vite Workspace, the Fastify API, and the idle worker.

Deploy notes: [`docs/deploy.md`](docs/deploy.md).
